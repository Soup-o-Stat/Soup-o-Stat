### **RTU MIREA Solved Tasks**
- **What are these?**: Due to the fact that I felt that some people were too arrogant, I hid all the repositories with solved tasks. Have fun!

### **Games**
- **What about games?**: Currently, my main engine is Godot Engine 4. I used to work with GameMaker Studio 2 and pygame (I still use pygame, but not for game projects right now)
